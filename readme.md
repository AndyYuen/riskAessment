I've created a 30+ minutes video on youtube to go with this repository:

https://youtu.be/JVVDLGt2jF8

No external tools are required to develop the application nor to deploy it in the Decision Server. The demo covers 5 topics. I've listed them below. It also gives the start time of each topic so that you can fast forward to a particular topic if you desire.

*  5.42 - Data Model and Business Rules
* 14.35 - Rule Flow
* 18.41 - Test Scenerios
* 21.58 - Deployment and Interaction
* 28.19 - Technical How-to's

I've replaced the Decision Table implementation of the Demographic Assessment with a DSL implementation. The video has not been updated to reflect that though.
